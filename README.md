## Galaga Like game for Terrasic DE-10 FPGA board in Verilog
# Made by Sean Copp and Mike Hickey

This is a project made by me and Mike for our Advance circuit design class. It uses on board buttons for controls. There is also the option to use an external controller using the GPIO pins. The controller used direct signals from a custom prototype PCB that Mike wired up. The music is played over a basic speaker on the GPIO pins and was intended to sound like Guile's Theme from Street Fighter 2, but once the music was coded into a Verilog file it sounded nothing like the source music.
